Created folder 'results_for_evaluation' that contains detections and results of different trackers. In this first version, inside each folder, the folder called 'public_mot15' means that the detections are those public from MOT15 dataset. The files inside the folder 'seqmaps' are used by MOT15 devkit to retrieve the list of sequences to analyse.

Created folder 'trackers_sourcecode' that contains trackers' source codes that will be analysed.

Added tracking code from TCVST. Results are a bit poor, maybe it needs some revision.

Added folder with altered detections. Created code to generate fake detections from ground truth.
