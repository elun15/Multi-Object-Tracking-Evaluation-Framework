MHT can be executed on Ubuntu without too much of a trouble. You should install

- sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 (because inside there is libgfortran)

then you can install

- sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

That's all you need. All the libraries inside MHT/external/* are already compiled for Linux 64.
